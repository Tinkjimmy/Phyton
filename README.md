# Exercise 1.2
## Task

- **name (str):** Contains the name of the recipe
- **cooking_time (int):** Contains the cooking time in minutes
- **ingredients (list):** Contains a number of ingredients, each of the str data type

I decided to use dictionaries to store data about the recipes because i needed to associate different pieces of information (attributes) with each recipe.this way it's going to be easy to retrieve informations about the recipes, it's better fo readability and i can store a variety of data.
I then decided to store the recipes in a list so that i can easily acces the recipes, extend the list with new recipes and iterate over it.
